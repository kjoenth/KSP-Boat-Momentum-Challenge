Boat Momentum Part and/or Fuel Efficiency Challenge

There have been challenges to build the fastest boat, and there have been heavy lift rocket challenges. Welcome to the boat momentum efficiency challenges.

Whether you are considering fuel efficiency or part efficiency (fewest number of parts), efficiency is a tough nut to crack. Arguably, building a very heavy AND fast AND efficient boat is harder than building a very light and fast boat, so let the kerbalizing begin!

Momentum Part Efficiency Scoring:

Total mass of your craft, multiplied by its velocity, divided by its part number

(mass of your ship*speed of your ship)/total number of parts

or

(tonne*m s-1)/part number = Part Efficiency Score.

Momentum Power Efficiency Scoring:

(Thrust of your ship * speed of your ship)/units of fuel per second

or

(kN*m s-1)/units of fuel per second = Power Efficiency Score.

Momentum Fuel Efficiency Scoring (for funzies):

(mass of your ship * speed of your ship)/units of fuel per second

or

(tonne*m s-1)/units of fuel per second = Momentum/Fuel Efficiency Score.

General Rules:

The craft must be carrying at least one Kerbal.
Hydrofoils are allowed BUT craft must not completely leave the water. That's called a plane.
MechJeb is allowed since it might make it easier for people to show values in the screen shot (see submission guidelines).
The intent is to build something using stock parts that works in KSP's normal physics. This means no mods that add parts, alter how stock parts work, or something that alters the aero- or hydro- dynamics (or other physical characteristics) of KSP. Something like MechJeb, even though it adds a part, is allowed since the part in question is essentially massless and can't effectively be used for structure, lift, or buoyancy. 
When reporting your fuel per second values, remember to add all the fuel being used together. If you are using rocket engines AND ion engines, you would add the liquid fuel, oxidizer, and xenon gas rates together to get one L/s value.
MechJeb is highly encouraged since it allows you to show part number, mass, etc on the same screen as your craft while it is underway.
Use of the debug toolbar for cheating is strictly not allowed. Of course, use of the debug menu to visualize aerodynamics when you are testing is allowed AND ENCOURAGED.
Submissions should be made in the latest version of KSP.
Submitters are encouraged to share their craft with others so we can improve on designs. 
Submission Guidelines:

Please include images or video of:

The boat moving through liquid at that speed.
The craft's mass while moving has to be shown. It's not enough to show the mass of the craft in a build area, since fuel might be consumed getting to the water or getting up to speed.
For the part efficiency challenge, the ship mass, velocity, and parts present must be shown in the image
For the fuel efficiency challenge, the ship thrust, velocity, and fuel used per second must be shown in the image
